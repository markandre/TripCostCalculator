# TripCostCalculator
Small C++ program I wrote to decide how to get to school

I wrote this while learning C++ at Miami Dade in downtown Miami.
This is basically just a calculator that allows the user to enter different values to quickly 
calculate how much it would cost to travel using various methods and changing certain variables.
